# gcloud-cluster
Scripting Gcloud cluster and httpd deployment

If you're running on Oracle Linux 9 execute the script on https://github.com/dantas404/Scripts.git
It contains the necessary installations to work with Kubernetes on GCP and Azure.
If you're running other distros, just check the script and go for the docs.
Don't forget to run 'chmod' on the scripts.
